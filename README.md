📧 Spam Email Detection Web Application
This project is a Machine Learning–based Spam Email Detection system built using Python, NLP, and Flask.
The application allows users to enter an email message and predicts whether it is Spam or Not Spam.

This project was developed as a learning and portfolio project by a Computer Science undergraduate.

🚀 Features
Spam / Not Spam classification
Text preprocessing using NLP techniques
Machine Learning model training
Flask-based web interface
Simple and user-friendly UI
🧠 Machine Learning & Model Training
The spam detection model is trained using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Steps involved:
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Lowercasing
Removing punctuation
Stopword removal
Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer
Model training using a Machine Learning algorithm
Trained model is saved as a .pkl file for inference
⚠️ Note:
The trained model file (.pkl) is not included in this repository for security and best-practice reasons.
